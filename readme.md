## About CMCSCS

Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) needed to introduce new website as option to garbage
collection. Mainly there has Admin, Captain (Manager), Volunteers, Staff. Public members can log into
this site and they can see articles in the website posted by admin and garbage collection spots. If anyone
likes to join with us they can Sign Up freely and after they add into our site as volunteer and Out of these,
one is selected as captain by admin. Members of the CMCSCS get an account after register in our site and
they can change their own profile picture and account password, If forgot password then he/she can reset
the password using email but they should remember their username. After click on forget password will
appear form to fill after filling that form we send link to their email and they can visit to that link and will
appear new window and they create new password.
Volunteer can report about thrown away garbage and can select level of garbage and set that
location and also they can take pictures and upload as well as they can explain the impact of throwing
garbage. Manager can check about that incident and he/she need to verify it after verify it garbage trucks
can collect them. If anyone cleaned that place before us volunteer can delete or update him/her post
before approving post by captain because staff can only clean that place after approving it by captain.
Captains have to check volunteers post are they true or not after checking he/she can approved it.
If volunteer put Level of garbage wrongly by mistaking, captain can change that garbage level and verify
it. If some volunteer post wrong information, captain can delete it. Staff can collect garbage, after report
accepting by captain.
Garbage collection staff can identify garbage collection spots approved by captain on a map and
they also can see articles posted by admin. After cleaning that place staff can mark it as completed and
also they can upload a picture after cleaning that place.
There should be an Administrator and he/she can create accounts for the captain, volunteer and
for the garbage collecting staff. Admin can post articles about garbage and he/she can add garbage
collection spots and garbage location on the map. Admin has dashboard and from that admin can see
pending cleaning places and orders to have approve and total cleaned points have they done and number
of members. Admin can change job type of the members. As an example admin can appoint volunteer as
captain (can change job role). Anyone can send messages such as complains or new ideas to improve our
site, to the admin via blog and admin can read that all and if need to reply to someone admin can do it.
Admin has power to block an account and remove member and if some volunteer post wrong information
admin can take an action against to that member. In the below mention access level in the system
